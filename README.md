Hi. i'm Meesum Naqvi
Here some description of what i have done in task

Desing:

Tried my best to do best with the desing, added couple of custom view classes which can be enhanced in case of proper requirement. I know there is a thing missing in Main screen which is colleciton view should have 4 elements in one screen, which is missed becasue i was not fimiliar with such kind of paging, i used a pod file for that to show banner, and same way we can do with collection view but needed some R&D which may cause time. Didn't have enough time becasue of working days and busy weekends at home. tried to cover maximum on sunday.

Application:

App has login screen, sign up screen, OTP screen to successfully register you on firebase. then you can enter in screen. Main screen has banner view, cart button, main menu button (With no action) and a collection view with items, cell with add to cart button and details of items. A screen with items details, which will have complete details of items.

Installation:

installation can be done by running app on mobile devices using xcode. need to login but first need to sign up. integration with firebase is also avaibale. you can sign up and then sign in. And use application

hopping for the best, fingers crosed,
Waiting for your response,
